Establishing Norms


Each group should discuss and provide an answer for the following questions

What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?
Get the whole group to vote

What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with? Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight - write a script for how you think that conversation should go.
Take a break first
Talk to the person first, ask them if they need help with what they’re working on
Give frequent status updates, what might be giving you more trouble than you thought
Update each other over slack!!

What does this group do when we merge our work together?
Do we do it together? Do we require sign off from someone else?
Do it together, when we review each other’s code

When does this group ask for help?
After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody's tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help?
Everyone should try to solve it, do research, ~15 minutes of research
Try first with your pair, then ask other pair

How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
Do members of a pair decide their own norms? Do they do things like keep a timer to switch positions? How often do we switch partners?
Change pairs per day
Day 1
Veronica - Gabby
Mimi - Neha
Day 2
Veronica - Mimi
Neha - Gabby
Day 3
Mimi - Gabby
Veronica - Neha
General pairing rules: fall into a rhythm and don’t be afraid to speak up i the rhythm isn’t working for you

How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present?
Preferably no
If it’s crunch time, we can evaluate and stay late one week night (to be talked about at standup)

What time does this group have daily stand up?
10:30 am (right after REACTO)
